Emphasis on immersion and making the world more alive. No ridiculous mobs or guns that break the game. Avoiding new items, general clutter and op changes to jobs.
Barotrauma is about misery, not all QoL upgrades are good.

[h1]Modlist[/h1]
All mods and what they do

[h3]Overhauls[/h3]
Read the mod descriptions for details
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488816950] Into the Abyss[/url] - Extended outposts, caves and alien ruins, difficulty increase, occupied beacons. Reactor upgrades replaced by Hazardous reactors.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547888957] Hazardous reactors[/url] - Making the reactors actually dangerous, read the guide or don't operate nuclear stuff.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488816950] Advanced medicine[/url] - Let the medic actually do something, read the guide or don't do medical stuff. In game hints are wrong and the game suggests healing items that won't do what you think they do.
[/list]

[h3]Assets[/h3]
[list]
[*]AeonBeaconStations - More varied beacons with a theme
[*]AeonWrecks - More varied wrecks to be encountered
[*]Beacons Extended - More varied 'basic' style beacons
[*]CR's Beacon Mod - Few bigger beacons with backstory and unique feel to them
[/list]

[h3]Immersion[/h3]
[list]
[*]DrainingHeadsets - Headsets consume battery
[*]Unknown artifacts - New artifacts + all artifacts look more or less the same. ID by effect.
[*]Dynamic Europa - Make the map feel less empty with more frequent locations
[*]Realistic fall damage - Blunt force trauma from falling. Damage depends on height, speed and what body part is impacted.
[*]Local voice fix (host only) - Makes local voice range smaller so you can't talk through the hull
[/list]

[h3]QoL[/h3]
[list]
[*]Combinable Coilgun Ammo
[*]Buy and Craft Electrics - Buy and craft research stations, batteries etc. to any ship
[*]RIBA Portable Items - Craft shelves, racks etc. Use in moderation.
[/list]

[h3]Should it be implemented?[/h3]
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2295227868&searchtext=]Underwater sledge[/url] - Lugging stuff around easier, but is it too easy?
[/list]

[h1]Possible problems[/h1]
[list]
[*]Breaks single player/bots.
[*]Since initial playtesting, haven't encountered crafting problems. Needs more testing.
[*]Some of the new beacons and wrecks are HUGE and filled with items, they have a chance of breaking the balance of the game. Some of the smaller new beacons seem to contain loads of items as well, we'll find out eventually how game breaking they are.
[*]Beacon reactor seemed to explode for no reason, further testing required.
[*]ITA increases difficulty, currently 100% vanilla guns.
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

Emphasis on immersion and making the world more alive. No ridiculous mobs or guns that break the game. Avoiding new items, general clutter and op changes to jobs.
Barotrauma is about misery, not all QoL upgrades are good.

[h1]Modlist[/h1]
All mods and what they do

[h3]Overhauls[/h3]
Read the mod descriptions for details
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488816950] Into the Abyss[/url] - Extended outposts, caves and alien ruins, difficulty increase, occupied beacons. Reactor upgrades replaced by Hazardous reactors.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2547888957] Hazardous reactors[/url] - Making the reactors actually dangerous, read the guide or don't operate nuclear stuff.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2488816950] Advanced medicine[/url] - Let the medic actually do something, read the guide or don't do medical stuff. In game hints are wrong and the game suggests healing items that won't do what you think they do.
[/list]

[h3]Assets[/h3]
[list]
[*]AeonBeaconStations - More varied beacons with a theme
[*]AeonWrecks - More varied wrecks to be encountered
[*]Beacons Extended - More varied 'basic' style beacons
[*]CR's Beacon Mod - Few bigger beacons with backstory and unique feel to them
[/list]

[h3]Immersion[/h3]
[list]
[*]DrainingHeadsets - Headsets consume battery
[*]Unknown artifacts - New artifacts + all artifacts look more or less the same. ID by effect.
[*]Dynamic Europa - Make the map feel less empty with more frequent locations
[*]Realistic fall damage - Blunt force trauma from falling. Damage depends on height, speed and what body part is impacted.
[*]Local voice fix (host only) - Makes local voice range smaller so you can't talk through the hull
[/list]

[h3]QoL[/h3]
[list]
[*]Combinable Coilgun Ammo
[*]Buy and Craft Electrics - Buy and craft research stations, batteries etc. to any ship
[*]RIBA Portable Items - Craft shelves, racks etc. Use in moderation.
[/list]

[h3]Should it be implemented?[/h3]
[list]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2295227868&searchtext=]Underwater sledge[/url] - Lugging stuff around easier, but is it too easy?
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2475230332]Stun nerf fix[/url] - Apparently stunning was nerfed beyond useless, need to be tested.
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2641040775]Let them in[/url] -  Would it be nice if bigger enemies could enter the ship, making it less a safe haven?
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2500953748]Pockets for all[/url] - Doctor gets pockets, why can't everyone else? 2 inventory per clothing
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2297409640]Meaningful drunkness[/url] - Make being drunk actually benefical, now you can kill yourself or friends with it and that's it. Also makes changes to tobacco apparently, which also is useless beyond RP reasons?
[/list]

[h1]Possible problems[/h1]
[list]
[*]Crafting problems persist, triple check mod load order.
[*]HR + advanced medicine causes annoying flashing when badly wounded + radiated
[*]Beacon reactor seemed to explode for no reason (once), further testing required.
[*]Since AeonBeaconStations is the top beacon mod, are we only loading those beacons? Based on testing I got 3 Aeonbeaconstations beacons.
[*]Some of the new beacons and wrecks are HUGE and filled with items, they have a chance of breaking the balance of the game. Some of the smaller new beacons seem to contain loads of items as well, we'll find out eventually how game breaking they are.
[*]Breaks single player/bots.
[/list]

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

[*]No changes to reactors allowed
[*]No changes to medical system or changes to afflictions allowed
